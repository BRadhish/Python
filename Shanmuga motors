The styling of the bike is similar to that of the Apache RTR 180 and it was last given a design update in 2012. The sharp and sporty styling is something that helps the TVS Apache rtr 160 stand apart from its rivals. Sharp design elements, including LED DRLs with pilot lamps lend the Apache RTR 180 aggressive looks. The motorcycle also gets lot of faux carbon fibre finish panels that are a neat addition. The bike sports a semi-digital instrument cluster with a large analogue tachometer. The clear lens LED tail lamp looks unique and the black finish on the alloy wheels and engine give the bike a good contrast.""")
